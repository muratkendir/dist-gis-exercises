    "## 0. Aim of the Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise primarily focuses on the usage of docker virtualization. You will practice with docker command line interface or the desktop application by running and inspecting some containers and images. In general, you will need to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to use Docker using the given preparation materials.\n",
    "- Run a **docker container** running the PlantUML Server on your own machine.\n",
    "- Try to reach out to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can refer to the following resources when needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1. General Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Check the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOTqprHv1YE\" target=\"_blank\">What is Docker and How it works?</a> video (16 min)\n",
    "- [ ] Check the page <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Docker - Get started - Introduction\"</a> and follow the instructions below one of the options (Docker Desktop / Play with Docker) (~15 min).\n",

    "- [ ] Docker Playground will be launched and a session will be started which will be live for 2 hours.\n",
    "- [ ] Click to *Add New Instance*\n",
    "- [ ] An instance runtime will be started with a specific local ip address and ssh key.\n",
    "- [ ] List the running docker containers by typing ```docker ps``` in the terminal screen (e.g. command prompt of the instance).\n",
    "- [ ] If you want to check all (running and idle) available docker containers, type ```docker ps --all```\n",
    "- [ ] Check all available commands: ```docker --help```\n",
    "- [ ] If you want to check command-specific options and arguments, type ```docker any_command -- help``` (For exp. ```docker ps --help```)\n",
    "\n",
    "> TIP: The terminal screen and available commands here will have the same or similar commands as a Linux terminal screen (command line), because usually the examples run on a Linux system. To check which version of Linux is used as the base operating system, type **uname -a** in the terminal.\n",

    "## 0.4 Why do we use Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain why we use virtualization tools such as Docker, we need to summarize the difficulties encountered in any programming process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A program script prepared in any programming language may depend on multiple libraries. It is important to know which version of which library is compatible with the main program. Incorrect versions of libraries can prevent the main program from running.\n",
    "- Codes prepared in programming languages do not run directly in machine code. They must be compiled to run in machine code. It is important to know on which hardware and operating system this compilation process is performed. Software compiled in one system configuration may not work in another configuration.\n",
    "- Running a program designed for server architecture can consume a lot of unnecessary resources. For example, the CPU processing power you allocate to run a single program when requested by clients remains idle when there are no requests for the same program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, taking advantage of virtualization tools such as Docker provides us with the following opportunities in programming and system architecture tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- System requirements are met directly on pre-configured virtual machines. The main program can be run directly along with dependent libraries.\n",
    "- Since the main program is compiled for virtual machines, these compiled and optimized configurations can be run directly on any other system.\n",
    "- Since virtualization tools (with Hypervisor support) operate on the principle of sharing system resources, software requirements can be distributed as needed. This results in a more efficient and environmentally friendly architecture. \n"
