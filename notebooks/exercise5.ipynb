    "## Aim of Exercise\n",
    "This exercise mainly focuses on Cloud Computing technologies and integrating cloud systems with GIS applications. You will practice with these systems to become more familiar with them by:\n",
    "- Using virtualization to create a mini-infrastructure and run a GIS application\n",
    "- Creating and serving a Tiled Map Layer and interconnecting the service with application interfaces/clients\n",
    "- Setting up and publishing a dashboard interface representing a filtered dataset from a Sensorthings API service\n",
    "\n",
    ">Check the \"**exercise5_preparation**\" document (pdf / ipynb) to review some useful resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to provide a web interface to show a map containing sensors' online location data, use a custom tiled layer as a base map, and provide some graphical visualizations based on these sensors using virtualization technologies.\n",
    "The steps required to achieve this goal will be as follows:\n",
    "- Setting up a docker container to run and serve **Geoserver** as a base map provider.\n",
    "- Setting up a docker container to run and serve **Grafana Dashboard** as the interface of our application.\n",
    "- Connecting the Grafana Dashboard to an online data source (based on **Sensorthings API**), which provides some sensors available in Hamburg city\n",
    "- Setting up the Grafana Dashboard interface to publish the **Tiled Map Layer** as the base map and the sensors as points\n",

    "Usually, map-based JavaScript libraries support overlaying the map with WMS or WMTS layers. However, the map viewer plugins available in Grafana have limited functionality. There are currently five map plugins (NativePlugin:GeoMap, WorldMap Panel, Orchestra Cities Map, Mapgl, TrackMap) with different features, none of which support adding WMS layers yet. The only possibility to add a base map to these map plugins is to publish a TMS service and connect it like an XYZ service (Check the previous section 2.3.3). "
