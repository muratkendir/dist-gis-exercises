    "## 0. Aim of the Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise primarily focuses on the usage of docker virtualization. You will practice with docker command line interface or the desktop application by running and inspecting some containers and images. In general, you will need to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to use Docker using the given preparation materials.\n",
    "- Run a **docker container** running the PlantUML Server on your own machine.\n",
    "- Try to reach out to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can refer to the following resources when needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1. General Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Check the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOTqprHv1YE\" target=\"_blank\">What is Docker and How it works?</a> video (16 min)\n",
    "- [ ] Check the page <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Docker - Get started - Introduction\"</a> and follow the instructions below one of the options (Docker Desktop / Play with Docker) (~15 min).\n",

    "- [ ] Click to <mark>Add New Instance</mark>\n",
    "- [ ] An instance runtime will be started with a specific local ip address and ssh key.\n",
    "- [ ] List the running docker containers by typing <mark>docker ps</mark> in the terminal screen (e.g. command prompt of the instance).\n",
    "- [ ] If you want to check all (running and idle) available docker containers, type <mark>docker ps \\-\\- all</mark>\n",
