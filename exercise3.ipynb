(If you want to try other XYZ basemap services, visit [Klas Karlsson's github repository](https://github.com/klakar/QGIS_resources/blob/master/collections/Geosupportsystem/python/qgis_basemaps.py) or search online.\n",

    "  - [ ] Find the city center of Hamburg on the map and zoom in until the canvas covers only some buildings. Alternatively, at the bottom of the QGIS window you can set the scale to 1:2000 or larger.\n",
    "> TIP: Sometimes you need to zoom in on your area of interest to avoid long loading times or just to make sure that the layer is visible in the area.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Check the coordinate system of the active map canvas (map widget in the software). If it is defined as OGC:CRS84, change it to EPSG:4326 Coordinate Reference System (CRS). You will notice some distortion on the map canvas, this is normal because EPSG:4326 (aka WGS84) is a geographic coordinate system, not a projected coordinate system. You may need to use this coordinate system from time to time because it is one of the most widely supported CRS by web services.\n",
    "- Check the type of web services you noted in section 1) and add them considering the type of web services.\n",
    "> TIP: There are multiple ways to check the type of web services. One could be to check the categories or filters available on the SDI website. The other method could be to check the metadata to find the type. Finally, if you segment the request URL, you might see a query parameter like \"service=WMS\" or \"service=WFS\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4a ii) Add WMS Service\n",
    "  - [ ] Go to **Layer > Add Layer > Add WMS/WMTS Layer** in the menu bar.\n",
    "  - [ ] To create a new connection, click the New button and copy & paste the URL you noted in part 1). Click OK and then click the Connect button.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4a iii) Add WFS Service\n",
    "  > **IMPORTANT NOTE** Some servers provide Complex Data Features with WFS services, which makes it difficult to add these services to GIS software. So, if you notice such a WFS with complex data, avoid adding this service.\n",
    "  - [ ] Go to **Layer > Add Layer > Add WFS / OGC API - Features Layer** in the menu bar. To create a new connection, click the New button and copy and paste the URL you noted in part 1). Specify the \"Max. number of features\" as 200 or less. Click OK and then click the Connect button.\n",
    "  - [ ] Click to any available layer in the service, check the coordinate system and click to Add Button.\n",
    "  - [ ] Select only a few features from the screen or press Ctrl + F6 buttons. Take a glance on existing attributes and values for the features.\n",
